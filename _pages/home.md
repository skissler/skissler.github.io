<!-- I work at the intersection of applied mathematics, computer science, and infectious disease epidemiology. 

Through my research, I try to understand how contagion affects our bodies, our communities, and our societies. 

Using equations and code, I aspire to bolster our ability to prepare from, manage, and heal from infectious disease crises. 

If any of this sounds interesting â€“ I'd love to chat!  -->



<!-- I work at the intersection of applied mathematics, computer science, and infectious disease epidemiology.  -->

<!-- <h2> Training background </h2> 
I trained in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder (B.S., M.S.) with David Bortz and then at the University of Cambridge (Ph.D.) with Julia Gog. I am now based at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. I will become an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder in August 2023.  -->
