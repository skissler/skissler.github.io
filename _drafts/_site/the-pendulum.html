    <p>Early in the pandemic, it was conservative-types who were disgruntled with the public health establishment: too many restrictions, to little account for anything other than the virus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past few weeks, something has shifted. We have had criticisms from all sides throughout the pandemic, but lately the loudest voices have been coming not from those who think we have done too much, but from those who think we are still doing too little.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The flashpoint for much of this was a recent article, The Forever Plague. It makes a number of plainly false claims, for example about repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections “eroding” the T-cell immune response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that the article demands to be taken seriously, if not literally: it voices an important concern that cannot be addressed by just pointing out the article’s many scientific flaws.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble is that, just like the conservative response in the earlier stages of the pandemic, the assertions that we are doing too little are not unfounded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CDC guideline on isolation periods do likely give the green light for individuals to re-engage with their ocmmunity when they could still be highly infectious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Long COVID is still poorly understood, and it is understandable that someone would be confused that public health practitioners invoked the precautionary principle so often as the pandemic was emerging, and yet so little now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should aim to look a layer deeper, past the scientific score-keeping (that’s not what this is really about, anyway) and to what is motivating these shifting, yet fundamentally related responses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first element is a disagreement about what is <em>safe</em>. “Is it safe to…?” was the most common question I received during the pandemic. I learned to respond not with an answer, but with another question: what are you trying to avoid? what do you have at stake? Safety, as an absolute, is an illusion: nothing we do is perfectly safe. I am reminded of a conversation with a colleague who, years ago, while in medical school, saw a teenage patient come into the emergency room. Their family had been driving through the city, safely and responsibly, when methane gasses ignited in the sewer beneath them and lifted a manhole cover six feet off the ground, smashing through their windshield and crushing the patient’s upper airway. Remarkably, the patient not only survived, but was able to attend the first week of college six weeks later. But the principle stands: nothing is absolutely safe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we answer questions about safety with others about risk tolerance, it often helps to make an immediate decision. Still, it is clear that the response is tinged with disappointment. We <em>know</em> that nothing is perfectly safe; why then do we still pursue that ideal?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am deeply sympathetic to the desire to know whether something is safe. For years I have grappled with anxiety and obsessive compulsive tendencies. For me, this usually looks like obsessing about developing a cancer or neurological disorder, then straining a muscle or digging off a layer of skin while engaging in repetetive behaviors to try to find some solace from the anxiety, which only serves to intensify it. At root, these anxieties are about the impossibility of knowing for sure whether something is safe. That uncertainty is deeply uncomfortable for all of us. For me I can’t avoid confronting that discomfort, because it becomes so outwardly noticeable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what are we to do? Through the course of my learning about and confronting anxiety and obsessions, I’ve learned that narratives are powerful driving forces in our lives. It is important to make those narratives concrete as much as we can, and then to analyze them, and then to consciously accept the ones that are true and leave the ones that are not. At root in these debates are cultural narratives, ideals that never existed and will never exist, and yet drive our powerful responses to the pandemic. In the first case, there is the ideal of a pure, true freedom, one in which everyone is perfectly free to choose the good, which means knowing the good, and having a perfectly aligned conscience to choose and manifest that knowledge. Of course, this has never existed and never will; we can strive for it, but in doing so we must acknowledge that our approach is going to be messy and asymptotic, never fully reaching our aim. This does not mean that it is a worthless aim to strive for, but it does change the way we relate to it: not as something to be defended, as if we could lose something we never had; but raether something to act as our guiding star, and accepted when the reality of life gets in the way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand is a narrative about health. In much of the developed world, we have lived without some of the major drivers of mortality that have affected our ancestors since the dawn of agriculture. Meanwhile, we have partitioned death and suffering off from the rest of society, making our own mortality easier to ignore. We come to believe that it is not only possible to live a long life, but that we deserve it, that health to the point of a painless death at 85 years is the way things should be. Anything else is an affront to justice. As before, I strongly believe that this is a worthwhile aim, something that should guide our hopes, our plans, and even our science. Yet to take such a life as a given is to equally ignore the very real truth of our mortality and to de-value the lives of those who are already living with debilitating conditions or terminal illnesses. Of course we should address infection and all of the other causes of suffering and mortality; this is the driving purpose of my career. Still, recognizing that our reality is not, and will never be, this ideal, is critical for moving forward in the debate about COVID-19 control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, as we see debates continue to rage around COVID-19 policies, it is worth bearing in mind that there truly are good policies and bad policies, policies that are more or less backed by science, that are more or less sensitive to the needs, fears, and aspirations of the socieites in which they are put in place. But beneath all of this is the stories that drive us, individually and as a culture. Articulating what these stories are, to ourselves and to those around us, is a fundamental step in finding common ground and moving these debates forward.</p>
