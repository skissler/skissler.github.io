I was speaking with a friend, a medical anthropologist who traces the origins of cryptic outbreaks. I brought up my latest interest: outbreak resilience, as contrasted with preparedness, or even management. Resilience, I argued, invites a useful change of perspective. Rather than anticipating threats or focusing on a swift response, resilience calls us to fundamentally examine how our societies, communities, and thinking is structured so that we might heal more effectively when an unforeseen crisis strikes. 

"Pessimist much?" she asked. I was surprised; to me, resilience is inherently hopeful. She went on: "It's the last think I expected to hear from you â€“ resilience is throwing in the towel. There's so much we can do to prevent disease; why accept it as it is, when we still have so much work to do?"

She has a point. I've been reading Thomas McKeown's _The Role of Medicine: Dream, Mirage, or Nemesis?_, and it lays out a compelling case that (a) most of the strides in mortality reduction and health improvement have come from advances in hygiene, engineering, and nutrition, not medicine; and (b) we still accept much higher rates of illenss than we need to, given further powerful, if less flashy, interventions we might consider.
